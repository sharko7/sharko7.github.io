# Hi there, I'm Shivam Khatri! ðŸ‘‹

Head of Logistics at **[Upside Down Labs](https://upsidedownlabs.tech/)**, where we're democratizing neuroscience through affordable, open-source DIY kits for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Human-Computer Interface (HCI) projects. We're passionate about making neuroscience accessible for everyone to explore biopotential signals (EEG, EMG, ECG, EOG).

Beyond logistics, I'm deeply involved in:

* **DIY Neuroscience:** Building and experimenting with open-source hardware and software to explore the fascinating world of neurotechnology.
* **Content Creation:** Crafting engaging content to share knowledge and inspire others in the tech and neuroscience communities.
* **Tech Exploration:** Always curious about new technologies and their practical applications.

At Upside Down Labs, we also focus on providing end-to-end hardware development services, from PCB design and prototyping to engineering consultation and mass production.

Feel free to connect and explore my projects!
